# This folder contain all works related to Structrued Query Languange using MySql workbench and Microsoft Server
- **EXTENSION**
  - CSV files extension are the files that will be imported to the database to answer questions on it.
  - BACPAC files extension are database that will be imported to Microsoft SQL server to answer the questions.
  - SQL files extension are the files that will open on MySQl workbench to answer or view the content.
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language to operate databases; it includes Database Creation, Database Deletion, Fetching Data Rows, Modifying & Deleting Data rows, etc.
- SQL is the standard language to communicate with Relational Database Systems. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their Standard Database Language.
- **SYNTAX**
  - **SELECT:** This is a syntax that is used to select or retrieve a particular column name
  - **FROM:** This syntax is used to select the table we are working on the database
  - **WHERE:** This is used to filter more information based on the condition specify in the where clause
  - **GROUP BY:** This is used when there is an aggregate fuction in the select statement
  - **HAVING:** This is used in conjunction with group by. It is also used to filter information based on the group by statement.
  - **ORDER BY:** This assembles the SQL output in either ascending or descending order based on the user descision.
  - **LIMIT:** This will restrict the SQL output to the integer value entered by the user.
- **AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS:** These are built in functions that perform some task like counting the number of rows, maximum values, summation of the data. All aggregate function are always with bracket opening and closing it without space between the name of the function and bracket.
  - **COUNT:** This function count the number of rows in the dataset. E.g COUNT(age).
  - **COUNT(DISTINCT):** This function return the distinct number values in the dataset. E.g COUNT(DISTINCT gender) will return 2.
  - **SUM:** This function will return the summation of the selected colunm. E.g SUM(age).
  - **MIN:** This function return the lowest value in the dataset based on the selected colunm field name.
  - **MAX:** This function return the highest values in the dataset based on the selected colunm field name.
- **STRING FUNCTIONS:** These are SQL built-in functions that allow users to manipulate the character data in various ways. These are:
  - **CONCAT:** This join two or more string together. E.g SELECT CONCAT('David', ' Joy'); *OUTPUT* David Joy
  - **LENGTH:** This return the length of the string in integer value. E.g SELECT LENGTH('interactive'); *OUTPUT* 11
  - **SUBSTRING:** This extract a substring from a larger string. E.g SELECT SUBSTRING('dragging', 1,4); *OUTPUT* drag
  - **LOWER:** This converts a string to lowercase. E.g SELECT LOWER('DRopPING'); *OUTPUT* dropping
  - **UPPER:** This converts a string to uppercase. E.g SELECT UPPER('dRopPiNG'); *OUTPUT* DROPPING
  - **TRIM:** This removes the whitespace or specified character from the beginning or end of a string. E.g SELECT TRIM('       inertcative element'); *OUTPUT* inertcative element
- **NUMBERS FUNCTIONS** These are also SQL built-in functions that allow users to manipulate the values. These are:
- **CAST:** This convert datatype from one to another. E.g SELECT CAST(21.5 AS CHAR); *OUTPUT* 21.5
- **RAND** This generate random decimal numbers for the user based on the max value which is 100 in this examples. SELECT RAND() * 100; *OUTPUT* '63.436587959003255'
- **ROUND:** This round the decimal number for the user based on the number of decimals needed by the user. E.g SELECT ROUND(63.436587959003255, 2); *OUTPUT* 63.44
- **FLOOR:** This output the integer part of the numbers. E.g SELECT FLOOR(63.536587959003255); *OUTPUT* 63
- **CEILING:** This output to the nearest integer for the value. E.g SELECT CEILING(63.1587959003255); *OUTPUT* 64
